## Description

This course trains students in the art and science of discovering, collecting, extracting, and organizing data in the Internet. The students will learn a series of strategies to extract information in the Web such as parsing HTML, selecting CSS elements, consuming RESTful and GraphQL API, and using automated webdrivers. Students will learn how to identify the most suitable approach and ethical considerations that must be taken through a series of case studies. A final group project will expose students to developing an application for collecting, extracting, and organizing data.

## Enrollment Requirements

Students should have completed *DS 5010: Programming for Data Science* or a comparable course.

## Course Materials

Students are expected to have access to computing resources including access to Internet. Some material will rely on using free services such as GitHub or Twitter. Students are generally expected to be willing to create an account with these platforms in order to be eligible to use these services.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Perform data discovery on the Internet;
2. Be proficient collecting web based data through HTML parsing, CSS selectors, REST/GraphQL API (including data as services), and using automated web drivers;
3. Use complimentary techniques such as parsing PDF files and optical character recognition;
4. Conduct ethical evaluations of potential data collection plans and best practices; and
5. Develop a pipeline to collect, extract, organize, and store data from web sources.

## Assignments and Grading

Grades are assigned per the default thresholds for [UVA](https://virginia.service-now.com/its/?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=1153c16fdba41f444f32fb671d961934#graduate).

There will be five problem sets assigned each worth 12% of the final grade. These will be assigned a week before they are due. Late work will carry a 10% penalty for each day after the deadline. Problem sets may be revised and resubmitted for partial credit.

A final group project which will account for 40% of the final grade. The project will be graded according to a provided rubric.
